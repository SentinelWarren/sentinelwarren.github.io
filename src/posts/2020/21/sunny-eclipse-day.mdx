Annular Solar day

Today Sunday, June 21, 2020 is the annular solar day, the day that an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon covers the sun from the center leaving the outer rim of the sun perceptible. It gives an impression of a ring – popularly called the "ring of fire". The word "annular" comes from a Latin word "annulus" meaning, "a ring".

The cool thing is, it also happens to be The Father's day { *Happy Father's day Alex, and well, all father's around the globe* }

On a sidenote, my subjective senses makes me feel like, today happen's to be the hottest day literally, when i was outside commutin/cruisingg around the steets, i felt like i was getting roasted by the fires of the Sun! I don't think though if that had anything to do with the annular solar eclipse that occured, its just the sun burning as usual.

So, back to the solars, what is a solar eclipse you might ask? *[Well according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse#Partial_and_annular_eclipses)*, a solar eclipse is when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon (syzygy) indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. Where as the solar eclipse happened today [on 21/06/2020 ] is an annular solar eclipse occuring when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide.
