PROJECTS:

Proprietary;

    • MUP( Micro Utility Platform )

Was part of the team that developed & maintained an automated Micro Utility Platform that is integrated to CRM solutions, Mobile Money payment gateways [ Mpesa, Tigo pesa, Halopesa, Airtel Money, Tpesa & MTN ] and a cloud metering system. The platform simplified customer orders creation ( using third part CRM solution i.e Salesforce ), by automatically parsing the payments made via MM to the metering system that the customers order was created on in real time. Previously the tasks were done manually by the operators. It was also linked to Bulk sms service for notification to the customers i.e. when they made payments, and for their other various services usage and payments processes in general. Also it helped to automatically switch the customer meters to 0(off) or 1(on) accordingly to customer balance, payments and usage status.

The platform we created had a huge impact on the site operations in general, especially to the Technical & Commercial teams, where as it simplified most of the work and allowed us to fully concentrate in executing other interesting innovative projects, and matter of fact, it has been deployed across more than 8 sites with more than 1500 customers that the company is currently operating both in Tanzania and Zambia

    • AutoQuickAdmin [ ENGIE Ensemble Support/PEO Project ]

Created internal ENGIE Powercorner automated tools to perform basic admin task i.e. O365 license assignment, Okta & Azure AD management, Mailboxes & Distribution List creation etc. It used ENGIE PEO web interface API protected through Okta auth.
On every API Call the API will create an object named request Container in the database. This object will contain all the parameters of AutoQuickAmin request or (requests if sent more than one request in the requests parameter) and the name of the specific product called. The PEO Engine check the request Container’s database collection to find new entries, if one is found it will process the request Container and create a request Item Object (in the database) for each request contained in the request Container. Then the PEO Engine execute each product and update the request Item status and result (Output parameters). Then AQA deals with the Output parameters accordingly. 

The tool simplified the IT team on performing bulk repetitive admin tasks, generated reports via user friendly dashboards for end of the month KPIs and overall improved the team workflow.
